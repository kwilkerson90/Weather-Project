Frontend Weather Project

-create a group repo
-create a wireframe 
-create the HTML markup
    -ex. grid or flexbox?
    -include input (search) box
    -make sure media queries are included
-create CSS styling- either from scratch or Bootstrap
-narrow down APIs that we want to use- weather API, live traffic API, Unsplash API (allows you to get random images using a search term)
-read and interpret API documentation
-create an XHR or fetch request for the weather data
-display results from the weather data; implement data via HTML and JS; find all the elements on the page and replace their content
-create event listeners (search button, enter key)
-add a voice functionality; gives weather/traffic-related prompts, i.e. "Slow down, the roads are slick!"
